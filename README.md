### Cartonnist and 3d Animator

>Student:Web Development 

I am a cartoonist that is currently working on independent projects. My focus is character development, storyline ideas, line art and page editing. I also
help build 3d animation characters and enviorments.


I enjoy drawing, working in Adobe applications, searching for artist related content to help create more unique images and learning about web development.
